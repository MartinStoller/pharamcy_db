# pharamcy_db


An imaginary pharmacy company has a central warehouse for all their products. From that warehouse individual stores can order their pharmaceuticals. 

The Task was to build a database that stores two tables (pharmaceutical stock and an order-history) with implemented CRUD functionality and Software Tests. 
The used technologies should be Spring-boot, Junit5 and Mockito.
This was my first time working with all of these technologies and the projects purpose was simply to learn about them.
