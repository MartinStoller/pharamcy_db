@Valid/@Validated:

@Validated annotates a class and indicates that certain parameters of this class need to be validated. Whenever
we want to validate simple values such as Requestparameters or Variables inside a class, this class needs to be
annotated with @Valdiated

@Valid annotates complex types such as request bodies or objects... this checks if the Datatype fullfills all the prerequisits
Both annotations are useless without more annotations inside the class such as @Min @Max @Size, which determine what is valid and what is not



@Request Parameter:
Typical url for an imaginary method with 2 request parameters (name and email) would look like:
localhost:8080/tableXY/changeEmailAndName?name=Maria&email=maria@gmail.com
the questionmark marks that now the requestparameters will be added. Everything before is the URL to that function. The "&" links multiple RPs
They are an alternative to using pathvariables
